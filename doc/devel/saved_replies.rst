Saved replies
=============

To consistently maintain respectful and welcoming communication, reduce potential bias and errors, consistently provide
relevant information, and to avoid repitition, we decided to create a collection of saved replies for recurring project
needs. As a an active Matplotlib contributor, consider storing some of these responses in your GitHub account’s
`saved replies`_ as they might prove useful while reviewing issues and PRs, and otherwise supporting other community
members. Some of the suggested saved replies can be long and detailed. This is because we aim to offer support without
assuming the level of experience, or the intent the community member we are addressing might have. There is still room
to tweak and personalize your  message if, for instance, some parts are redundant, require further information, or to
offer further support. Using these replies is optional.

First Pull Request Merged
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. code-block:: md

    Hi-five ✋ on merging your first pull request to Matplotlib, @username! We hope you stick around and invite you to
    continue to take an active part in Matplotlib! Your choices aren’t limited to programming 😉 – you can review pull
    requests, help us stay on top of new and old issues, develop educational material, refresh our documentation, work
    on our website, and so much more! For more info, check out: https://matplotlib.org/devdocs/devel/index

    Did you know we have a monthly meeting 👥 for new contributors and a weekly meeting for the maintainers,
    everyone is welcome to join both? You can find out more about our regular project meetings in this
    [calendar page](https://scientific-python.org/calendars/).

    Also, consider joining our [developer mailing list](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/matplotlib-devel) ✉️.
    This is a great way to connect with other people in our community and be part of important conversations that
    affect the development of Matplotlib.

Rebase
^^^^^^
.. code-block:: md

    Hi, it looks your code needs to be rebased to include changes that have since occurred in the main repository. Would
    you like to do this yourself, or would you like us to do this for you? I’m asking because a rebase can get a bit
    fiddly and not everyone likes doing them 😉

    We documented [the rebase process here](https://matplotlib.org/devdocs/devel/git_workflows#rebase.html) Have a look and
    let me know how you'd like to proceed.
