Plot types gallery
==================

The plot type gallery displays a selection of the common visualization techniques that
are implemented in Matplotlib. The gallery is heavily curated and tightly scoped to the
plotting methods on `matplotlib.axes.Axes` so additions are generally discouraged.

Format
------
* very short: 5-10 lines
* self explanatory data
* little to no customization.
