Examples gallery
================

The gallery of examples contains visual demonstrations of Matplotlib features. Gallery
examples exist so that readers can scan through visual examples. Unlike tutorials or
user guides, gallery examples teach by demonstration, rather than by instruction or
explanation.

Gallery examples should avoid instruction or excessive explanation except for brief
clarifying code comments. Instead, they can tag related concepts and/or link to relevant
tutorials or user guides.

Format
------

All :ref:`examples-index` should aim to follow the following format:

* Title: 1-6 words, descriptive of content
* Subtitle: 10-50 words, action-oriented description of the example subject
* Image: a clear demonstration of the subject, showing edge cases and different
  applications if possible
* Code + Text (optional): code, commented as appropriate + written text to add context
  if necessary

Example:

The ``bbox_intersect`` gallery example demonstrates the point of visual examples:

* this example is "messy" in that it's hard to categorize, but the gallery is the right
  spot for it because it makes sense to find it by visual search
* :ref:`sphx_glr_gallery_misc_bbox_intersect.py`
