Deprecation of savefig-time modification of the figure patch face and edge colors
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

The ``facecolor``, ``edgecolor``, and ``transparent`` keyword arguments to
`~.Figure.savefig` and `~.FigureCanvasBase.print_figure`, and the associated
``savefig.facecolor``, ``savefig.edgecolor``, and ``savefig.transparent``
rcParams, have been deprecated.  As a replacement for the first two
options, directly set the facecolor and edgecolor of the figure patch
(``figure.patch``), or set the ``figure.facecolor`` and ``figure.edgecolor``
rcParams.  As a replacement for ``transparent``, set both the figure
patch color and the axes patch color to transparent, or likewise set the
corresponding rcParams.
