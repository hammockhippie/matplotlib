`ColorBar` raises TypeError rather than ignore user input
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

In ``__init__`` `ColorBar` ignores user supplied ``cmap`` and ``norm``
keyword arguments in favor of retrieving those values from the
``mappable`` passed in.  If those keywords are supplied, `ColorBar`
will now raise a `TypeError` rather than silently dropping user supplied
input.

If ``mappable`` is a `contour.ContourSet` then a `TypeError` will be raised
if the user provides any of
``('alpha', 'boundaries', 'values', 'extend', 'filled')``
