`Artist.update` has return value
````````````````````````````````

The methods `matplotlib.artist.Artist.set`,
`matplotlib.Artist.update`, and the function `matplotlib.artist.setp`
now use a common codepath to look up how to update the given artist
properties (either using the setter methods or an attribute/property).

The behavior of `matplotlib.Artist.update` is slightly changed to now
sort by key name and returns a list of the returned values from the
setter methods to avoid changing the API of
`matplotlib.Artist.set` and `matplotlib.artist.setp`.
