Round instead of truncating pixel number when using Agg
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````

When rasterizing a figure the allowed figure sizes are effectively
discretized by the finite dpi.  Previously, we simply truncated when
computing the number of pixels to use, now we use `numpy.round` which
will avoid floating point issues when setting the size of the figure
in inches to get a specific size of in pixels.

Additionally, the Agg based backends will adjust the size of the
figure to match the actual size (given by the number of pixels and the
dpi) during the draw process.
