Added 'orientation' kwarg to quiver
```````````````````````````````````

Prior to this change, quiver defined arrow angles as positive
counter-clockwise from a horizontal axis that is positive to
the right.  In most applications, however, one wants the
arrows to retain their orientation relative to the data
axes; for example, inverting the y-axis should cause the
arrows to be reflected about the x-axis.  This behavior can
now be enabled in `Axes.quiver` and `plt.quiver` with the
kwarg `orientation='relative'`.  For the present release,
the old behavior is retained as the default, with
`orientation='absolute'`.
