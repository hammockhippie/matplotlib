`Legend` initializers gain edgecolor and facecolor kwargs
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

The :class:`~matplotlib.legend.Legend` background patch (or 'frame')
can have its `edgecolor` and `facecolor` determined by the
corresponding keyword arguments to its initializer, or to any of the
methods or functions that call that initializer.  If left to
their default values of `None`, their values will be taken from
`rcParams`.  The previously-existing `framealpha` kwarg still
controls the alpha transparency of the patch.
