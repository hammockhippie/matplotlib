Do not use backend fallback if backend in explicitly set
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

If the backend is selected via ``mpl.use``,  setting the
``MPLBACKEND`` env, or directly setting ``rcParams['backend']`` prior
to importing pyplot, do not attempt to fallback to a backend compatible
with the currently running event loop.  If the backend in set via a
configuration file, it will respect the value of ``'backend_fallback'``
in the file (and continues to default to True).

This is mostly relevant on headless servers.  Having a configuration
file with an interactive backend will correctly fallback to a
non-interactive backend but code that calls ``matplotlib.use`` will
fail on pyplot import.
