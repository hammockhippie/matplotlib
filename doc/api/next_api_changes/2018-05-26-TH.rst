Removed proprietary sphinx directives
-------------------------------------

The matplotlib documentation used the proprietary sphinx directives
`.. htmlonly::`, and `.. latexonly::`. These have been replaced with the
standard sphinx directives `.. only:: html` and `.. only:: latex`. This
change will not affect any users. Only downstream package maintainers, who
have used the proprietary directives in their docs, will have to switch to the
sphinx directives.
