Changes to _AxesStack, preparing for its removal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The behavior of the internal ``.figure._AxesStack`` class has changed
significantly in the process of removing the old behavior of gca() with regard
to keyword arguments. When the deprecated behavior has been fully removed and
gca() no longer takes keyword arguments, the ``.figure._AxesStack`` class will
be removed.
