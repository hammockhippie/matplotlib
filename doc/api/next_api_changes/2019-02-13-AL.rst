Deprecations

``ticker.decade_up`` and ``ticker.decade_down`` are deprecated.

Autoscaling changes
```````````````````
On log-axes where a single value is plotted at a "full" decade (1, 10, 100,
etc.), the autoscaling now expands the axis symmetrically around that point,
instead of adding a decade only to the right.
