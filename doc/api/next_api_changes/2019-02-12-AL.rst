Changes in handling of degenerate bounds passed to `set_xlim`
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

When bounds passed to `set_xlim` (`set_xlim`, etc.) are degenerate (i.e. the
lower and upper value are equal), the method used to "expand" the bounds now
matches the expansion behavior of autoscaling when the plot contains a single
x-value, and should in particular produce nicer limits for non-linear scales.
