Lazy color resolution for patches
`````````````````````````````````

Patches now lazily resolve colors and apply alpha at draw time, similarly
to Line2Ds.  In particular, this means that they will be affected by later
modifications to :rc:`patch.facecolor` and :rc:`patch.edgecolor`, and that
``patch.get_facecolor()`` and ``patch.get_edgecolor()`` no longer necessarily
return RGBA tuples but rather whatever was passed in with the corresponding
setters.

:rc:`hatch.color` is still resolved at artist creation time as there is no
other way to set the hatch color.
