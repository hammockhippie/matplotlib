The the style changes introduced in seaborn 0.9 have been included in the
Matplotlib seaborn styles.
Most notably, the color palettes have been extended from 6 to 10 colors.
The former 6-color palettes are still available via a '6' suffix in the
style name, e.g. ``plt.style.use('seaborn-bright6')``.
