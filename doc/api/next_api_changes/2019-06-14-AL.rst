Deprecation of hinting_factor
`````````````````````````````

The ``hinting_factor`` parameter of `.ft2font.FT2Font` and `.font_manager.get_font`,
and :rc:`test.hinting_factor`, are deprecated.  Their default value have been
changed to 1, which will be the only value supported in after the deprecation
period ends.
