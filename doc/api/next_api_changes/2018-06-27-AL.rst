Changes to backend loading
``````````````````````````

Assignment to ``rcParams["backend"]`` now sets the backend.  Backends can now
be switched until a figure is actually created.

Failure to load backend modules (``macosx`` on non-framework builds and
``gtk3`` when running headless) now raises `ImportError` (instead of
`RuntimeError` and `TypeError`, respectively.

Third-party backends that integrate with an interactive framework are now
encouraged to define the ``required_interactive_framework`` global value to one
of the following values: "qt5", "qt4", "gtk3", "wx", "tk", or "macosx". This
information will be used to determine whether it is possible to switch from a
backend to another (specifically, whether they use the same interactive
framework).
