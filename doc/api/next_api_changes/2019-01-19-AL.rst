Deprecations
````````````

Support for passing single-letter colors (one of "rgbcmykw") as UPPERCASE
characters is deprecated; these colors will become case-sensitive (lowercase)
after the deprecation period has passed.

The goal is to decrease the number of ambiguous cases when using the ``data``
keyword to plotting methods; e.g. ``plot("X", "Y", data={"X": ..., "Y": ...})``
will not warn about "Y" possibly being a color anymore after the deprecation
period has passed.
