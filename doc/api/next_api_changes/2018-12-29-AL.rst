Changes to search paths for FreeType and libpng
```````````````````````````````````````````````

The ``MPLBASEDIRLIST`` environment variables and ``basedirlist`` entry in
``setup.cfg`` have no effect anymore.  Instead, if building in situations where
FreeType or libpng are not in the compiler or linker's default path, set the
standard environment variables ``CFLAGS``/``LDFLAGS`` on Linux or OSX, or
``CL``/``LINK`` on Windows, to indicate the relevant paths.

See details in :file:`INSTALL.rst`.
