Changes in AFM parsing
``````````````````````

In accordance with the AFM spec, the AFM parser no longer truncates the
``UnderlinePosition`` and ``UnderlineThickness`` fields to integers.

The ``Notice`` field (which can only be publically accessed by the deprecated
``afm.parse_afm`` API) is no longer decoded to a `str`, but instead kept as
`bytes`, to support non-conformant AFM files that use non-ASCII characters in
that field.
