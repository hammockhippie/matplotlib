Axis-dependent Locators and Formatters explicitly error out when used over multiple Axis
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

Certain Locators and Formatters (e.g. the default `AutoLocator` and
`ScalarFormatter`) can only be used meaningfully on one Axis object at a time
(i.e., attempting to use a single `AutoLocator` instance on the x and the y
axis of an Axes, or the x axis of two different Axes, would result in
nonsensical results).

Such "double-use" is now detected and raises a RuntimeError *at canvas draw
time*.  The exception is not raised when the second Axis is registered in order
to avoid incorrectly raising exceptions for the Locators and Formatters that
*can* be used on multiple Axis objects simultaneously (e.g. `NullLocator` and
`FuncFormatter`).

In case a Locator or a Formatter really needs to be reassigned from one axis to
another, first set its axis to None to bypass this protection.
