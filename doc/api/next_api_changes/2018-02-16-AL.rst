```````````

The ``manage_xticks`` parameter of `~Axes.boxplot` and `~Axes.bxp` has been
renamed (with a deprecation period) to ``manage_ticks``, to take into account
the fact that it manages either x or y ticks depending on the ``vert``
parameter.

When ``manage_ticks`` is True (the default), these methods now attempt to take
previously drawn boxplots into account when setting the axis limits, ticks, and
tick labels.
