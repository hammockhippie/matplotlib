Changes to the wx backend
`````````````````````````

- ``FigureFrameWx`` no longer attaches a ``FigureManagerWx``
  to the figure.  Instead, the ``FigureManagerWx`` is
  now created by ``backend_wx.new_figure_manager`` or
  ``backend_wx.new_figure_manager_given_figure``, consistently with the
  other backends.  Accordingly, the ``FigureFrameWx.figmgr`` attribute
  and ``FigureFrameWx.get_figure_manager`` method are deprecated (use the
  cross-backend ``figure.canvas.manager`` instead).
- The *frame* argument and attribute of ``FigureManagerWx`` are deprecated, for
  consistency with other backends.  The ``FigureManagerWx.window``
  attribute is now always set to the canvas' parent.
