``arrow`` method is deprecated
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `~.axes.Axes.arrow` method is deprecated, and is scheduled to be
removed in Matplotlib 3.9.  It only produces properly shaped
arrow heads if the aspect ratio of the axes is 1, and the parameters to
control the size of the arrow heads is in data space, and hence
unintuitive.  Users should use `~.axes.Axes.annotate` to create arrows.
