New `Formatter.format_ticks` method
```````````````````````````````````

The `Formatter` class gained a new `~Formatter.format_ticks` method, which
takes the list of all tick locations as a single argument and returns the list
of all formatted values.  It is called by the axis tick handling code and, by
default, first calls `~Formatter.set_locs` with all locations, then repeatedly
calls `~Formatter.__call__` for each location.

Tick-handling code in the codebase that previously performed this sequence
(`~Formatter.set_locs` followed by repeated `~Formatter.__call__`) have been
updated to use `~Formatter.format_ticks`.

`~Formatter.format_ticks` is intended to be overridden by `Formatter`
subclasses for which the formatting of a tick value depends on other tick
values, such as `ConciseDateFormatter`.
