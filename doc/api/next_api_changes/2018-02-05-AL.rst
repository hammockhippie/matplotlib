Changes to the internal tick handling API
`````````````````````````````````````````

``Axis.iter_ticks`` (which only served as a helper to the private
``Axis._update_ticks``) is deprecated.

The signature of the (private) ``Axis._update_ticks`` has been changed to not
take the renderer as argument anymore (that argument is unused).
