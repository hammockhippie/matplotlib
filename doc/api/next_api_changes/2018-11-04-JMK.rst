get_window_extents changes:
---------------------------

`.matplotlib.axes.Axes.get_window_extent` used to return a bounding box
that was slightly larger than the axes, presumably to take into account
the ticks that may be on a spine.  However, it was not scaling the tick sizes
according to the dpi of the canvas, and it did not check if the ticks were
visible, or on the spine.

Now  `.matplotlib.axes.Axes.get_window_extent` just returns the axes extent
with no padding for ticks.

This affects `.matplotlib.axes.Axes.get_tightbbox` in cases where there are
outward ticks with no tick labels, and it also removes the (small) pad around
axes in that case.  

`.spines.get_window_extent` now takes into account ticks that are on the
spine.
