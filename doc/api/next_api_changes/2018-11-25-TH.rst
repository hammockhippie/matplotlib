New rcparams ``hist.edgecolor`` and ``hist.linewidth``
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````
The new rcparam ``hist.edgecolor`` allows to expicitly define an edge color
for the histogram bars. Previously, this could only be achieved by setting
``patch.edgecolor`` and ``patch.force_edgecolor``, which may have affected
other plot elements unwantedly.

Additionally, the new rcparam ``hist.linewidth`` specifies the linewdith of
the bar edges.
