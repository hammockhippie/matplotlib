`~Axes.bxp` now respects :rc:`boxplot.boxprops.linewidth` even when *patch_artist* is set
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

Previously, when the *patch_artist* parameter was set, `~Axes.bxp` would ignore
:rc:`boxplot.boxprops.linewidth`.  This was an oversight -- in particular,
`~Axes.boxplot` did not ignore it.

This oversight is now fixed.
