Deprecations
````````````

``Text.is_math_text`` is deprecated.

``TextPath.is_math_text`` and ``TextPath.text_get_vertices_codes`` are
deprecated.  As an alternative to the latter, construct a new ``TextPath``
object.

The ``usetex`` parameter of ``TextToPath.get_text_path`` is deprecated and
folded into the ``ismath`` parameter, which can now take the values False,
True, and "TeX", consistently with other low-level text processing functions.

Behavior changes
````````````````

Previously, if :rc:`text.usetex` was True, then constructing a `TextPath` on
a non-mathtext string with ``usetex=False`` would rely on the mathtext parser
(but not on usetex support!) to parse the string.  The mathtext parser is not
invoked anymore, which may cause slight changes in glyph positioning.
