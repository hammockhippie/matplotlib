Change to the output of `.image.thumbnail`
``````````````````````````````````````````

When called with ``preview=False``, ``image.thumbnail`` previously returned an
figure whose canvas class was set according to the output file extension.  It
now returns a figure whose canvas class is the base `FigureCanvasBase` (and
relies on `FigureCanvasBase.print_figure`) to handle the canvas switching
properly).

As a side effect of this change, `image.thumbnail` now also supports .ps, .eps,
and .svgz output.
