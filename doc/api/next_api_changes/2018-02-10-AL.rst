Deprecations
````````````

The ``mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1.colorbar`` module and its colorbar implementation
are deprecated in favor of :mod:`matplotlib.colorbar`, as the former is
essentially abandoned and the latter is a more featureful replacement with a
nearly compatible API (for example, the following additional keywords are
supported: ``panchor``, ``extendfrac``, ``extendrect``).

The main differences are:

- Setting the ticks on the colorbar is done by calling ``colorbar.set_ticks``
  rather than ``colorbar.cbar_axis.set_xticks`` or
  ``colorbar.cbar_axis.set_yticks``.
- The colorbar's long axis is accessed with ``colorbar.xaxis`` or
  ``colorbar.yaxis`` depending on the orientation, rather than
  ``colorbar.cbar_axis``.
- Overdrawing multiple colorbars on top of one another in a single Axes (e.g.
  when using the ``cax`` attribute of `~.axes_grid1.axes_grid.ImageGrid`
  elements) is not supported; if you previously relied on the second colorbar
  being drawn over the first, you can call ``cax.cla()`` to clear the axes
  before drawing the second colorbar.

During the deprecation period, the ``mpl_toolkits.legacy_colorbar``
rcParam can be set to True to use ``mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1.colorbar`` in
:mod:`mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1` code with a deprecation warning (the default),
or to False to use ``matplotlib.colorbar``.
