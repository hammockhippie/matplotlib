Changes to ``twin*`` methods in `mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1`
-----------------------------------------------------------

Previously, calling `~mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1.parasite_axes.HostAxesBase.twin`,
`~mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1.parasite_axes.HostAxesBase.twinx` or
`~mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1.parasite_axes.HostAxesBase.twiny` on
`mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1` host axes would hide the host axes' own axis
lines so that there is no overdrawing with the twin/parasite axes' axis lines.
This could lead to surprising behavior in certain cases
(`#10748 <https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/10748>`_), so the
logic has now been reversed, such that host axis lines are kept visible and
twin/parasite axis lines are hidden. This may break code which relies on the
specifics of host/parasite axis line visibility.
