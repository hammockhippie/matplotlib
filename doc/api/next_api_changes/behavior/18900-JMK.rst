Axes used to make colorbar now wrapped
======================================

The axes used to place a colorbar is now wrapped by a new parent class
(``ColorbarAxes``) when the colorbar is created::

    cb = fig.colorbar(im, cax=cax)

Now ``cb.ax`` returns the parent ``ColorbarAxes``, and to get
``cax`` back, you can do::

    cb.ax.parent_axes

The parent axes (``cb.ax.parent_axes``) handles the
placement of the colorbar axes object, and its aspect ratio, but the child
axes (``cb.ax``)  handles all the tick parameters, labelling, and holds the
artists that make up the colorbar.  We have attempted to dispatch the
appropriate colorbar methods to the appropriate axes.  

Colorbar lines no longer clipped
================================

If a colorbar has lines added to it (e.g. for contour lines), these will
no longer be clipped.  This is an improvement for lines on the edge of
the colorbar, but could lead to lines off the colorbar if the limits of
the colorbar are changed.
