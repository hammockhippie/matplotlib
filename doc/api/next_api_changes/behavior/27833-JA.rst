SVG output: improved reproducibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A problem that caused some plots to `produce different SVG output on each render <https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/27831>`, even with a static ``svg.hashsalt`` configuration setting, was discovered.

The cause relates to use of a non-deterministic ID scheme for non-rectangular clip paths, and a change has been applied to use a monotonically increasing integer ID scheme for those elements instead.

Provided that plots add non-rectangular clip paths in deterministic order, this should provide repeatable (a.k.a. reproducible, deterministic) SVG output.
