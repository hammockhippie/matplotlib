SVG output: improved reproducibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some SVG-format plots `produced different output on each render <https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/27831>`, even with a static ``svg.hashsalt`` value configured.

The problem was a non-deterministic ID-generation scheme for non-rectangular clip paths; the fix introduces a monotonically increasing integer ID scheme for those elements instead.

Provided that any plots that use non-rectangular clip paths add them in a deterministic order, this should provide repeatable (a.k.a. reproducible, deterministic) SVG output.
