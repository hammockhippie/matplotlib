pyplot.specgram uses origin='upper' even if an different kwarg or rcParam value is set  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Previously if ``image.origin`` was set to something other than upper or if 
the ``origin`` kwarg was passed with a value other than upper, the spectrogram
itself would flip, but the axes would remain oriented for an origin value 
of 'upper', so that the resulting plot was incorrectly labelled.

Now, the ``origin`` kwarg and ``image.origin`` rcParam are ignored and the 
function matplotlib.pyplot.specgram is forced to use ``origin='upper'``, so that
the axes are correct for the plotted spectrogram.
