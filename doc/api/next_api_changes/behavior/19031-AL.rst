``artist.set_picker(False)`` disables artist picking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Previously, setting the ``picker`` property of an artist to any non-None value,
including ``False``, would keep picking enabled.  This was deemed a bug;
now, truthy values enable picking and falsy ones disable it.  The default is
now ``False`` instead of ``None``, but both mean that picking is disabled by
default.
