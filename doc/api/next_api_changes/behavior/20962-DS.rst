Unit converters can now support units in Scalar Mappables
---------------------------------------------------------

`~.cm.ScalarMappable` can now contain data with units.
For this to be supported by third-party `~.units.ConversionInterface`s,
the `~.units.ConversionInterface.default_units` and
`~.units.ConversionInterface.convert` methods must allow for the *axis*
argument to be a `~.cm.ScalarMappable` object, and
`~.units.ConversionInterface.convert` must be able to convert data of more than
one dimension (e.g. when plotting images the data is 2D).

The ``Quiver`` ``units`` property is renamed ``arrow_units``
------------------------------------------------------------
This is to clarify the meaning of this property, and enable support for color
mapped data with units in the future. The corresponding keyword argument to
`~.quiver.Quiver` is also renamed.
