``fig.subplot_mosaic`` no longer passes the ``gridspec_kw`` args to nested gridspecs.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Previously, the ``gridspec_kw`` dictionary was passed to the nested
gridspecs, as well as the outer gridspec. This caused errors with many
options, such as the ``"width_ratios"`` and ``"height_ratios"``
options if the inner layout was incompatible with either of these
ratios. This dictionary is no longer passed to the inner layouts, and
users are directed by the docstring to construct the layout manually
if the inner layouts require any of these args.
