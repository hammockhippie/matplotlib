``fig.subplot_mosaic`` no longer passes the ``width_ratios`` or ``height_ratios`` args to the nested gridspecs.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Previously, the entirety of the ``gridspec_kw`` dictionary was passed
to the nested gridspecs. This caused an error if the inner layout was
incompatible with one of these ratios. A new dictionary is now made,
``nested_gs_kw``, where the ``"width_ratios"`` and ``"height_ratios"``
keys have been removed, which is passed to any nested gridspecs. This
prevents such errors.
