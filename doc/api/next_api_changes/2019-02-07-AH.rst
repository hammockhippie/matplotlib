Modify output of Axes.hist when input consists of multiple empty lists
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

Input that consists of multiple empty lists will now return a list of histogram
values for each one of the lists. For example, an input of ``[[],[]]`` will
return 2 lists of histogram values. Previously, a single list was returned.
