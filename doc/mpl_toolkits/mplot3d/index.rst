Matplotlib mplot3d toolkit
==========================
The mplot3d toolkit adds simple 3d plotting capabilities to matplotlib by
supplying an axis object that can create a 2d projection of a 3d scene.
The resulting graph will have the same look and feel as regular 2d plots.

The interactive backends also provide the ability to rotate and zoom
the 3d scene.
