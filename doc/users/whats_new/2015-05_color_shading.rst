Easy color shading
``````````````````
Often we would like the ability add subtle color variation to our plots,
especially when similar element are plotted in close proximity to one another.
:func:`matplotlib.colors.shade_color` can be used to take an existing color and
slightly darken it, by giving a negative percentage, or to slightly lighten it,
by giving a positive percentage.
