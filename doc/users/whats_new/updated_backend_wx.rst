wx backend has been updated
---------------------------
The wx backend can now be used with both wxPython classic and
`Phoenix <http://wxpython.org/Phoenix/docs/html/main.html>`__.

wxPython classic has to be at least version 2.8.12 and works on Python 2.x,
wxPython Phoenix needs a current snapshot and works on Python 2.7 and 3.4+.

User code is responsible to set the wxPython version you want to use, see for
example the `examples\user_interfaces\embedding_in_wx2.py`.
