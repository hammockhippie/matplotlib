PGI - Pure Python GObject Introspection Bindings
------------------------------------------------

For the GTK3 backend, matplotlib now supports PGI bindings as an alternative
to PyGObject.  By default matplotlib will still use PyGObject, otherwise it
will look for pgi.  You can change this behaviour through the rcParam
backend.gi_preference which takes either a string, or a list of strings in
order of preference.
