Decorators to ensure an Axes exists & ``plt.quick_axes``
--------------------------------------------------------

Added a top-level function to `pyplot` to create a single axes
figure and return the `Axes` object.

Added decorators ::

  ensure_ax
  ensure_ax_meth
  ensure_new_ax

which take a function or method that expects an `Axes` as the first
positional argument and returns a function which allows the axes to be
passed either as the first positional argument or as a kwarg.  If the
`Axes` is not provided either gets the current axes (via `plt.gca()`)
for `ensure_ax` and `ensure_ax_meth` or creating a new single-axes figure
(via `plt.quick_axes`) for `ensure_new_ax`
