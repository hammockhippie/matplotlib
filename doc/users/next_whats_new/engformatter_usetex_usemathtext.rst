`EngFormatter` now accepts `usetex`, `useMathText` as keyword only arguments
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

A public API has been added to `EngFormatter` to control how the numbers in the
 ticklabels will be rendered. By default, ``useMathText`` evaluates to
 ``rcParams['axes.formatter.use_mathtext']`` and ``usetex`` evaluates to
 ``rcParams['text.usetex']``.

If either is ``True`` then  the numbers will be encapsulated by ``$`` signs.
 When using ``TeX`` this implies that the numbers will be shown in TeX's math
 font. When using mathtext, the ``$`` signs around numbers will ensure unicode
 rendering (as implied by mathtext). This will make sure that the minus signs
 in the ticks are rendered as the unicode-minus (U+2212) when using mathtext
 (without relying on the ``fix_minus`` method).
