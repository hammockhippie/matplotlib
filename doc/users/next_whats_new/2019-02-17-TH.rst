Support for forward/backward mouse buttons
``````````````````````````````````````````

Figure managers now support a ``button_press`` event for mouse buttons, similar
to the ``key_press`` events. This allows binding actions to mouse buttons (see
`.MouseButton`).

The first application of this mechanism is support of forward/backward mouse
buttons in figures created with the Qt5 backend.
