Added `Axis.get_inverted` and `Axis.set_inverted`
`````````````````````````````````````````````````

The `Axis.get_inverted` and `Axis.set_inverted` methods query and set whether
the axis uses "inverted" orientation (i.e. increasing to the left for the
x-axis and to the bottom for the y-axis).

They perform tasks similar to `Axes.xaxis_inverted`, `Axes.yaxis_inverted`,
`Axes.invert_xaxis`, and `Axes.invert_yaxis`, with the specific difference that
`.set_inverted` makes it easier to set the invertedness of an axis regardless
of whether it had previously been inverted before.
