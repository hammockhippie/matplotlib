New `.axes.Axes.colorbar` method for attaching colorbar to single axes
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

A simple wrapper for `.Figure.colorbar` that allows the user to omit the
``ax`` kwarg. The new ``ax.colorbar(mappable)`` is equivalent to
``fig.colorbar(mappable, ax=ax)``.
