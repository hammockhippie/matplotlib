Introduction of :rc:`hist.histtype`
```````````````````````````````````

The default value of the ``histtype`` argument to `Axes.hist()` can now be
controlled using :rc:`hist.histtype`.  For large numbers of bins, setting
this value to 'step' or 'stepfilled' can result in significant performance
improvements over 'bar', the current default.
