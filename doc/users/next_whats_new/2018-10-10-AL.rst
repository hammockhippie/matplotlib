Improved formatting of image values under cursor when a colorbar is present
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

To format image values under the mouse cursor into the status bar, we now
use the image's colorbar formatter (creating a hidden colorbar on-the-fly if
necessary).  For example, for an image displaying the values 10,000 and 10,001,
the statusbar will now (using default settings) display the values as ``10000``
and ``10001``), whereas both values were previously displayed as ``1e+04``.
