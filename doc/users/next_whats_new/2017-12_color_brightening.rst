Color brightening
----------------------

Often we would like the ability add subtle color variation to our plots,
especially when similar element are plotted in close proximity to one another.
`matplotlib.colors.brighten_color` can be used to take an existing color and
brighten or darken it, by giving a positive or negative fraction.
