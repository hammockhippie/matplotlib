Cyclic colormaps
----------------

Two new colormaps named 'twilight' and 'twilight_shifted' were added.
These colormaps start and end on the same color, and have two
symmetric halves with equal lightness, but diverging color. Since they
wrap around, they are a good choice for cyclic data such as phase
angles, compass directions, or time of day. Like viridis, twilight is
perceptually uniform and colorblind friendly.
