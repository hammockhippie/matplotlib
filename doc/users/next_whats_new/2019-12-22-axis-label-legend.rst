Support for axis label legends
------------------------------

Legends can now be placed next to axis labels, enabling more
space-efficient and intuitive ``twinx()`` plots. Such legends are created
using ``plt.xlabel_legend()`` and ``plt.ylabel_legend()``, which each
accept one artist handle as understood by ``plt.legend()``.
