``violinplot`` now accepts color arguments
-------------------------------------------

The ``~.Axes.violinplot`` constructor now accepts ``color``, ``facecolor``,
and ``edgecolor`` as input arguments. This means that users can set the color
of violinplots as they make them, rather than setting the color of individual
objects afterwards.
