Controlling and labelling Axis objects
--------------------------------------

Matplotlib ``~matplotlib.axis.Axis` objects can be controlled and manipulated
using the `~matplotlib.artist.Artist` class. These tutorials cover the basics
of the usage of Axis objects and controlling them in Matplotlib.

For even more information see the  :ref: `examples page <axisartist>`


Some good material in artist tutorial that should be cribbed from or used here.
