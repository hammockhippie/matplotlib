Controlling and Labelling Axis Objects
--------------------------------------

Matplotlib `~.axis.Axis` objects are a type of Artist that
are the underlying abstraction and the basis for the axes
on a Matplotlib figure or visualization. Axis objects are
capable of controlling and modifying axis on a figure,
which can include alignment, direction, style, curve,
and more.
